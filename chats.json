{"chats":["<!--   Hey! I'd love to help ya come up with a name. What's the general idea for this app?   -->\n    <!-- Could be anything!-->\n<!--   Ah, so... is the idea that it'll be a massively collaborative app, that becomes whatever the group of people working on it feels like making?   -->\n    <!-- yep! -->\n<!--   Neato. _thinking_  -->\n<!--   OK, here's one idea: Megazord. Might be copyrighted... but. The idea of a bunch of power rangers combining their individual Zords\n      to create a Megazord that's more powerful than the sum of its parts... seems relevant. \n\n& Maybe we take the Mega part and add something else to be original? + 1Ô∏è‚É£\n\nYeah, dang: http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state=4807:54u9io.2.43\n\n& I like 'TYPED DRAWING' thank you patent and trademark office!\n\nWas this Glitch inspired by https://github.com/chaosbot/chaos ? Saw that on... maybe r/programming this morning.\nYeah, here: https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/6criij/chaos_a_social_coding_experiment_that/\n\n & No, but very similar! haha, weird timely coicidences\n\nOne of these two projects is going to lead to the singularity. I, for one, welcome our Glitch-born robot overlord.\n\n1:58 ET -- I have to jump on a call but please invite anyone to edit, edit link is in README.\n\n2:36 PM ET -- Seems we've reached the practical limitations of https://button.glitch.me üòÜ\n\nbutton.glitch.me has a bug: Anonymous users show up as `null`.\n\nüëÜ Maybe the project owners should ask for help on that :)\n\nAccess requested.\n\n\n2:50 PM ET -- Setting up Browserify, as learned from https://glitch.com/edit/#!/browserify-middleware\n\n3:23 ET -- Help request keeps disappearing? \n  - seems to be working now, maybe because I was repeating questions?\n  \n@j-f1: why not use an extant chat solution (such as Gitter)? \n\n -- I like the idea of the chat existing within the app, but there are no rules!\n\n\n5/23   4:22 ET: Is this running very very slow for everyone else?\n      4:24 ET: Commented out the wormhole, seems to have fixed the slowness\n-- yep, it is weird!","üåµ - Would be cool to set up a chat feature on the frontend!\n\n@mrdavidjcole: Just set up a little script to hit the Glitch API from this app's frontend to get info about itself. Maybe useful for that chat feature? Check out the object in the console. Current users on the project are in data.users\n\n\n@mrdavidjcole: I... may have just constructed a wormhole.\n\n -- Woah (look at live frontend)\n\nPerhaps we should start collecting a visual history of this app? Not sure how much history Glitch is already collecting behind the scenes, but it'd be neat to be able to see how the app evolves overtime. Though, we might bump into proejct size limits quickly if we upload too many images to `assets`. 'up to 512MB of assets storage' - https://glitch.com/faq\n\n@pirijan: I would love that, I captured some of the super early days at http://pketh.org/designing-glitch.html , but the ongoing little things would be really fun to look back on\n\n> Not sure how much history Glitch is already collecting behind the scenes\n@j-f1: If you open the console, you can run `git log` to see the autogenerated Checkpoint commits.\n@mrdavidjcole: Whoa neat! Wait... where the heck is the console input?\n@j-f1: Run `application.console()` in the DevTools on this page. Console opens in a new window.\n\n  -- Could do regular github exports?\n  -- Exported from a download, maybe Glitch export will work once there's something in there?\n    https://github.com/themostcollaborativewebsite/themostcollaborativewebsite\n\nShall we start @tagging ourselves in chats? Or do we like the anonymousness of it as-is?\n  @patricküåµ Seems like if people want to?\n  \n  \n  \n? Maybe some sort of template library/framework/system would help?\n\n\n@mrdavidjcole: added a mousetail at 6:03 PM EDT. I'm not sorry.\n@mrdavidjcole: now it's a randomized emoji. Still no regrets.\n\n9:10 PM ET - Going to try putting in a very simple chat that writes to a .json file\nüëçüöÄ\n\nHmm, doesn't seem to be working, have it working in a different glitch project though\n\nChat working now at /chat, not sure how buggy writing to a .json file will be on here","First chat, hard coded","\"test2\"","seems to be working now","hey there","well hello!","¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø","Seems like adding timestamps and optional name would be good?\n","This page is constantly reloading for me in Chrome, working in Firefox though","yeah\nalso is multiline necessary?","it'd be nice to press enter to submit","message test test","the reloading happens if you opened this tab from the Glitch editor.
