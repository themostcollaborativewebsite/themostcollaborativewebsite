<!--   Hey! I'd love to help ya come up with a name. What's the general idea for this app?   -->
    <!-- Could be anything!-->
<!--   Ah, so... is the idea that it'll be a massively collaborative app, that becomes whatever the group of people working on it feels like making?   -->
    <!-- yep! -->
<!--   Neato. _thinking_  -->
<!--   OK, here's one idea: Megazord. Might be copyrighted... but. The idea of a bunch of power rangers combining their individual Zords
      to create a Megazord that's more powerful than the sum of its parts... seems relevant. 

& Maybe we take the Mega part and add something else to be original? + 1️⃣

Yeah, dang: http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state=4807:54u9io.2.43

& I like "TYPED DRAWING" thank you patent and trademark office!

Was this Glitch inspired by https://github.com/chaosbot/chaos ? Saw that on... maybe r/programming this morning.
Yeah, here: https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/6criij/chaos_a_social_coding_experiment_that/

 & No, but very similar! haha, weird timely coicidences

One of these two projects is going to lead to the singularity. I, for one, welcome our Glitch-born robot overlord.

1:58 ET -- I have to jump on a call but please invite anyone to edit, edit link is in README.

2:36 PM ET -- Seems we've reached the practical limitations of https://button.glitch.me 😆

button.glitch.me has a bug: Anonymous users show up as `null`.

👆 Maybe the project owners should ask for help on that :)

Access requested.


2:50 PM ET -- Setting up Browserify, as learned from https://glitch.com/edit/#!/browserify-middleware

3:23 ET -- Help request keeps disappearing? 
  - seems to be working now, maybe because I was repeating questions?
  
@j-f1: why not use an extant chat solution (such as Gitter)? 

 -- I like the idea of the chat existing within the app, but there are no rules!


5/23   4:22 ET: Is this running very very slow for everyone else?
      4:24 ET: Commented out the wormhole, seems to have fixed the slowness
-- yep, it is weird!
