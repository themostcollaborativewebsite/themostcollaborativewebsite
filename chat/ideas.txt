üåµ - Would be cool to set up a chat feature on the frontend!

@mrdavidjcole: Just set up a little script to hit the Glitch API from this app's frontend to get info about itself. Maybe useful for that chat feature? Check out the object in the console. Current users on the project are in data.users


@mrdavidjcole: I... may have just constructed a wormhole.

 -- Woah (look at live frontend)

Perhaps we should start collecting a visual history of this app? Not sure how much history Glitch is already collecting behind the scenes, but it'd be neat to be able to see how the app evolves overtime. Though, we might bump into proejct size limits quickly if we upload too many images to `assets`. "up to 512MB of assets storage" - https://glitch.com/faq

@pirijan: I would love that, I captured some of the super early days at http://pketh.org/designing-glitch.html , but the ongoing little things would be really fun to look back on

@j-f1: If you open the console, you can run `git log` to see the autogenerated Checkpoint commits.
@mrdavidjcole: Whoa neat! Wait... where the heck is the console input?
@j-f1: Run `application.console()` in the DevTools on this page. Console opens in a new window.

  -- Could do regular github exports?
  -- Exported from a download, maybe Glitch export will work once there's something in there?

Shall we start @tagging ourselves in chats? Or do we like the anonymousness of it as-is?
  @patricküåµ Seems like if people want to?
  
  
  
? Maybe some sort of template library/framework/system would help?


@mrdavidjcole: added a mousetail at 6:03 PM EDT. I'm not sorry.
@mrdavidjcole: now it's a randomized emoji. Still no regrets.

9:10 PM ET - Going to try putting in a very simple chat that writes to a .json file
üëçüöÄ

Hmm, doesn't seem to be working, have it working in a different glitch project though

Chat working now at /chat, not sure how buggy writing to a .json file will be on here
